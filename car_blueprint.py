# The __init__() Method
# __init__() is the special method that initializes an individual object. This method runs automatically each time an object of a class is created.

# The __init__() method is generally used to perform operations that are necessary before the object is created.
#When you define __init__() in a class definition, its first parameter should be self.
# The self parameter refers to the individual object itself. It is used to fetch or set attributes of the particular instance.

# This parameter doesnâ€™t have to be called self, you can call it whatever you want, but it is standard practice, and you should probably stick with it.

    #This is how we would create an object from this class
    #Object #Class
        

    #The attributes of an instance are accessed and assigned to by using dot . notation.

    #Access the Atributes
